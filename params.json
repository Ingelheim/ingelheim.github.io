I have `good sense of humor`, an ability to `communicate well` and experience in interacting with `diverse international teams`. I am also willing to put in the time needed to `get the job done.`\r\n\r\n_Anonymous comments from pairing partners I've paired with:_\r\n```\r\n\"I really enjoyed pairing with you.\r\nI like your hunger to not only produce the right code,\r\nbut understand the reasoning behind why that code works.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our styles are a little different,\r\nbut I get inspired by your tenacity and excitement about solving problems.\"\r\n\r\n\"Honestly, you're a pretty good partner to have. Keep it up!\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### I love learning and teaching\r\n\r\nThere is a saying in medical education that says that a procedure is best taught, by `seeing one`, `doing one` and `teaching it` to another person.\r\n\r\nAfter learning myself from great mentors and peers in pairing sessions, I spent the last four weeks at Dev Bootcamp being a `teaching assistant` for younger students, primarily helping getting unstuck, `debugging` code and `refactoring` to achieve a better `code quality`.\r\n\r\nRecently, I also became a coach/mentor for `Rails Girls Berlin`!\r\n\r\n### I am curious\r\nI am curious person and I am passionate about what I am doing!   \r\nHere are `three facts` why:\r\n\r\n**FACT 1:** My biggest hobby, _by far_, is the `generation of business ideas` and the creation of `prototypes.`\r\n\r\n**FACT 2:** I love `traveling the globe`, `meeting new people` from all over the place, eating `interesting food` and visiting `cool places`.\r\n\r\n**FACT 3:** `Tinkering` with `new exciting technologies` is awesome! Currently I am totally hooked on new input devices such as the `LeapMotion` or `MYO`.\r\n\r\n  \r\n### I have a round profile\r\nDue to my prior experience `running an internet startup`, working at an `internet incubator` and `finance` and `consulting` experience, I have a round profile that extends the profile of just being technical.\r\n\r\n- I can `communicate well`. Not only with technical, but `also non-technical people`\r\n- I worked at a lot of clients before and can adapt pretty well to `new working environments`\r\n- I did a lot of `financial modeling` and know how to `work within a budget`\r\n- I am `empathic of clients` (internal and external) and have `business savvy` at the same time \r\n- I `led` and worked as `part of a team` before\r\n   \r\nIf you are interested in my `resume` you can find it right [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oubn07jgvajre3s/Resume_Lukas_Ingelheim.pdf) \r\n\r\n\r\n### My recent projects\r\n**Iterim CTO - Full Stack / August 2013 - Currently**\r\n```\r\nwhat: Full stack (Rails, OO JS, HTML, CSS) app project in Munich with team \r\nmanagement responsibilities\r\nmy focus: Full app\r\n```\r\n   \r\n   \r\n**SpotifyMotion - Node.js / September 2013**\r\n```\r\nwhat: Node.js app (webkit), packaged as OSX app for LeapMotion. \r\nSubmitted to the Airspace Store\r\nmy focus: Full app\r\n```\r\n   \r\n   \r\n**iTunesMotion - Node.js / September 2013**\r\n```\r\nwhat: Node.js app (webkit., packaged as OSX app for LeapMotion. \r\nSubmitted to the Airspace Store\r\nmy focus: Full app\r\n```\r\n   \r\n   \r\n**Raise Your Hand - Rails (Final project at Dev Bootcamp) / Juli 2013**\r\n```\r\nwhat: Interactive video tutorials based on Youtube videos\r\nmy focus: Video player and comment stream in Javascript\r\n```\r\n[link](http://raiseyourhand.herokuapp.com/) | [github](https://github.com/JasonBenn/raiseyourhand)\r\n   \r\n      \r\n**Photooverflow - Rails / Juli 2013**\r\n```\r\nwhat: StackOverflow clone geared towards photographers (group project)\r\nmy focus: Backend setup, model and integration testing\r\n```\r\n[link](http://ask-about-photos.herokuapp.com/) | [github](https://github.com/codesliced/ask-about-photos)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Insideguide - Sinatra / June 2013**\r\n```\r\nwhat: App based on the Google maps API to create custom travel guides.\r\nmy focus: Full app\r\n```\r\n[link](http://insideguide.herokuapp.com/) | [github](https://github.com/Ingelheim/app_insideguide)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Survey Monster - Sinatra / June 2013**\r\n```\r\nwhat: Survey monkey clone (group project)\r\nmy focus: Survey creation (Object oriented Javascript / Ajax)\r\n```\r\n[link](http://surveymonster.herokuapp.com/) | [github](https://github.com/aarondufall/survey-monkey)\r\n\r\n\r\n**NFL Scraper - Ruby / May 2013**\r\n```\r\nwhat: Scraper for the player names and teams of NFL.com.\r\nmy focus: Full app after 2 weeks of Ruby programming\r\n```\r\n[github](https://github.com/Ingelheim/NFL_SCRAPER)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
